Major planning for all social games has already started from the start of Autumn 2024. However, the main preparation will start in July, near the start of the offline part of the camp.
Structure:
The games are planned to capture the spirit of Hogwarts School of Wizards and try to contemplate the games repeated in the original book series by J.K. Rowling “Harry Potter”. For now the following can give you the overview of the games, but for more information please follow the Google Sheet “Program Schedule: Hogwarts Summer School Project 2025”
- Quidditch Tournaments: Engage in thrilling matches that test your teamwork, strategy, and a dash of magical prowess.
- Care of Mythical Beasts: Learn about the fascinating world of magical creatures (inspired by Care of Magical Creatures lessons) through interactive exhibits and guest lectures, sparking discussions about real-world conservation efforts.
- Charms for Collaboration: Participate in workshops that hone your communication and teamwork skills, all with a sprinkle of magical inspiration.
# Budgeting
For exact calculations: Expences: The list of expenses was built based on the extensive experience of organizers gained from previous cohorts and based on the advice of NewUU Authorities.
Based on the calculations, it has been concluded that in the best-case scenario (presents of good quality, food of good quality, and monetary reward for mentors for their 1-year contribution) approximately $87 will be needed to sustain 1 participant. For this reason, the amount of participants will depend on the collected budget, else participants without sponsorship coverage will need to self-fund their stay in the camp. The maximum capacity of the camp will be 200 participants.
